# RoLiteRPC
A lightweight background program that enables Rich Presence for Roblox Player.<br>
Requires no credentials or installing.

## How to use
* Download a version from the [releases](https://github.com/EmK530/BloxDump/releases) page.<br>
* Extract the program and DLLs into a folder.<br>
* Then simply run RoLiteRPC and you should have Rich Presence for what you're playing!

## Drawbacks
Because of the goal of being a "no setup" program, for proper detection you have to join games<br>
from the Roblox website for RoLiteRPC to properly detect what you are playing.<br>

You also can't leave and join another game from Roblox's in-app browser<br>
otherwise RoLiteRPC will think you are still playing the same game.
